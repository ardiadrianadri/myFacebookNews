# Facebook news paper

It was my proposal for the hackathone of March 3 and 4.
The idea is an application that connects to a personal Facebook account and creates a newspaper with the user's last activity publication.

# Test the app:

In the main folder run the next commands
 1- **npm install** to install the dependencies
 2- **npm start** to start the web server

 To access at the app, open a web browser and navigate at the address http://localhost:4200
